Story Outline for Citi Bike Tableau Dashboard
Introduction: Welcome to the New York Citi Bike Program Dashboard! As the new lead analyst, you’re tasked with presenting insights from recent Citi Bike data.

Top Stations and Routes

Objective: Identify high-traffic stations and popular routes.
Story Insight: Visualize the most frequently used stations and busiest routes with a bar or heat map. Insights can help city officials understand which areas might need more bikes or expanded docking stations.

Story Insight: Pie or bar charts could showcase user demographics, informing decisions around targeted marketing or additional infrastructure in underrepresented areas.
Trip Duration Analysis
